1. The Architectural ContextThis project is built on a Shared-Kernel approach within a Maven Multi-Module setup. It leverages Spring Cloud for orchestration and Hibernate/JPA for data persistence.The "Golden Thread" of a Request:Entry Point (API Gateway): Every request hits the Gateway. It acts as the security guard, calling the Identity Service to validate JWTs before routing traffic.Identity & RBAC: The Identity Service uses MapStruct for compile-time DTO mapping and Java Records for immutable request validation. It issues JWTs containing roles (EMPLOYEE, VENDOR, ADMIN).Persistence & Soft Delete: All entities extend a BaseEntity. We don't "hard delete" data; we use Hibernate 6.x @SQLRestriction to filter out records where deleted = true.The Audit Trail: * Data Audit: Every row insertion/update is automatically timestamped and tagged with the performing user's ID via JPA AuditorAware.Action Audit: We use AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) to intercept service and controller methods, logging execution time and parameters via SLF4J without touching business logic.Unified Response: No matter which service you hit, the response always follows the ApiResponse<T> contract, ensuring the frontend handles data and errors consistently.2. Key Components ChecklistIf a developer joins, they just need to look at these three spots to understand the "magic":ComponentResponsibilityTech UsedBaseEntityMandatory columns (created_at, updated_by, deleted)JPA @MappedSuperclassLoggingAspectCross-cutting logging of every API call and performance metricsSpring AOPAuditorAwareBridges Security Context to JPA to identify "Who" did the changeSpring SecurityGlobalExceptionHandlerStandardizes error responses into the ApiResponse format@RestControllerAdvice3. Developer Workflow (How to build a new feature)To maintain this standard, a developer follows this flow:Define a Record for the Request (with validation).Define a Class for the Response.Extend BaseEntity for the new Database Entity.Define a MapStruct Interface to bridge them.Write business logic in the Service; AOP will handle the logs automatically.Note to Developer: "We follow the Fail-Fast principle. If your MapStruct fields don't match or your Record validation fails, the system will catch it before the database is even touched."
